# KaoYanBao
KaoYanBao is a lightweight review platform based on data mining for students who are going to take part in the postgraduate entrance examination.

## Modules
KaoYanBao is mainly composed of three modules:
- Wrong Practice Review

In this module, users can record the wrong practices online, so that users can review afterwards. This module supports rich texts to enter wrong practices and upload pictures. At the same time, it supports keyword searching and subject filtering for the wrong practices.


- Auto Paper Construct

In this module, user characteristics would be extracted according to the wrong questions recorded by users. Then, data mining methods such as collaborative filtering and Apriori algorithm are used to recommend questions to the user according to their weak knowledge points.


- Information Square

In this module, the platform will automatically crawl the information about the postgraduate related information and push it to the user.
